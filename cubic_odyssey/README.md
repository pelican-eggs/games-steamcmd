### Game Description
From Atypical Games, Published by Gaijin Network Ltd [Website](https://cubicodyssey.game/en/):
#### Adventure, creation, and survival await!
> Step into a boundless open world where every planet, every system, and every moment is yours to shape. Explore a universe rich with life, ancient mysteries, and untamed beauty. Fight back the Red Darkness menace as you mine resources, craft tools, weapons, and build vehicles that are essential for your odyssey. Collaborate with friends to battle colossal threats and bring hope to the galaxy.
##### Huge Open Cubic World
> Every star seen in the sky or in space is the light of a star system. Each star is orbited by planets filled with life, with shifting day-night cycles, bustling NPC cities, pirate outposts, and dangerous ruins waiting to be discovered.
##### Crafting and Building Paradise
> Mine resources, refine materials, and build everything from tools and outposts to vehicles and starships.
##### Endless Galactic Odyssey
> Take on diverse quests, uncover secrets of the forgotten civilization, trade with NPCs, or battle rogue pirates as the epic story of saving the galaxy unfolds before you.

###### Fun Co-op Gameplay
> Join forces with others to take down massive enemies, initiate orbital laser strikes, or build cooperative megastructures.
##### Limitless Exploration
> Venture across hundreds of star systems filled with rich ecosystems, alien flora and fauna, and ever-changing environments.
##### RPG-style Depth
> Level up your skills, unlock new crafting recipes, and shape your character’s journey through meaningful choices and upgrades.
##### Intense Red Darkness Battles
> Combat a spreading galactic infection that mutates wildlife, consumes planets, and threatens all life. Your actions can cleanse the plague — or let it thrive.
##### Ground, Air and Space Traversal
> Switch between planetary vehicles and spaceships, exploring from the ground up—or the skies down. Experience warp jumps between star systems, cruise at blazing fast speed between planets or just use the planetary speeders to travel on planets.
