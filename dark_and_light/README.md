The egg was made following the dedicated server setup on the Dark and Light fandom: https://darkandlight.fandom.com/wiki/Dedicated_Server_Setup

## Recommended server settings

### Minimum RAM

No dedicated server requirements could be found, so assume they are similar to those of an ARK: Survival Evolved server. Dark and Light was made from ARK, so many of the parameters are the same as well.

See the following - <https://ark.gamepedia.com/Dedicated_Server_Setup#Hardware>

### RCON

The server requires a local RCON connection to function. You will see RCON connection refused messages until the server has successfully started and connects to the RCON, which can take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes. The RCON Port is only required for external RCON connections.
