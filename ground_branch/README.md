### Server Configuration

**NOTE: Server Name and Max Players will be overwritten by your Startup settings every time the server is started.**

#### In-Game Setup (Recommended):

Configuring all aspects of the server (MOTD, game rules, map list, admins, etc.) is, by far, the easiest (and safest) to do in-game via the built in admin menu. Perform the following steps to do so:

1. Start the server.
2. Navigate to `/home/container/GroundBranch/ServerConfig` within the file browser and open `AdminSetupPassword.txt`.
3. Copy the code and start your personal Ground Branch game client.
4. Log into your server via the server browser by searching for it by the name you set in the Startup tab of the server.
5. Open the console by pressing `` ` `` and run the following command: `admin setup <your_setup_password>`. This will add you as a SuperAdmin.
6. Running the command `admin` will open the Admin Menu where you can configure everything about the server.

#### Manual Setup (Advanced):

All configuration files for the server can be found here: `/home/container/GroundBranch/ServerConfig`

Please refer to the [Unofficial Ground Branch Wiki](https://unofficialgroundbranchwiki.com/en/dedicated-servers/getting-started) for configuration info.

### Modding

At the time of writing this (2023/08/01), no workshop mods for Ground Branch exist. However, if they were to be introduced or you would like to install a mod, mods can be installed to `/home/container/steamapps/workshop/content/16900/`. The server should then stage them to `/home/container/GroundBranch/Mods` and show up as "Mod ID #" in the in-game modding menu.
