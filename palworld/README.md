## Known Issues / FAQ

1) The server won't show up in the Community-Server tab.<br>
-> This is a known problem and the devs will hopefully fix that asap. Best choice is to connect by IP and Password.

2) The server has a memory leak.<br>
-> This is also an issue that they are aware of.<br>
-> The `bEnableInvaderEnemy` option seems to have a huge impact on the current RAM usage. Disabling it might be choice.<br>
-> Tip: Schedule a server restart every 6h. You might adjust the value according to your system!<br>

3) The server does not show up in the steam server list.<br>
-> This is currently and might never be supported.

4) The config file gets deleted / reset on server restart.<br>
-> Before editing the config file always make sure to fully stop the server first. Otherwise all changes wont be saved.

## Recommended server settings

### RAM

Due to at least one memory leak the server requires about 16-32GB RAM.<br>
Referring to the [official documentation](https://tech.palworldgame.com/dedicated-server-guide) you can start the server with 8GB but you will run out of memory very quickly.<br>
The minimum should be 16GB but 32GB are fairly recommended for now.<br>

### CPU

Intel / AMD processor with at least 4 cores.

### Storage

As of January 19th 2024 the server requires about 5GB of storage capacity. This might extend with further content/updates.

## Server Ports

| Port            | Default |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Game            | 8211    |
| RCON (optional) | 25575   |

The RCON port does not need to be allocated.

### Updating

1. Update your egg
2. Update the startup of all already made servers to the one that now comes with the egg
3. Then hit reinstall because the parser application has to be downloaded
4. Because the Palworld devs forgot with the v0.1.5.0 to add the new `bShowPlayerList` key to the config you will need to add it yourself. This maybe fixt in the future. Its default value is False

Example of the end of the config: `bUseAuth=True,bShowPlayerList=False,BanListURL="https://api.palworldgame.com/api/banlist.txt")`

### Variable Parsing

The parser application that is currently being shipped is capable of editing all variables that are present in the Palworld configuration file as of February 1, 2024.

However, only the most basic and necessary variables are present in the egg.
Those who need more variables will have to add them themselves.

See a list of what key matches with what variable [Here](https://github.com/QuintenQVD0/Palword-server-config-parser?tab=readme-ov-file#key-with-variables)

**Variables that do not exist will automatically be skipped parsing so you do not have to worry about it emptying your config file**

### Proton

There is a special egg that uses proton instad of the native linux version what shipes with `winmm.dll` and `RE-UE4SS` so for they who want to run mods then that is possible.

Keep in mind this eggs console output is broken (thanks proton / wine) so you will only see the parser output. The RCON console does still work.


### Config

The config is found at the following path: `Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini` or if you are running the proton egg `Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/PalWorldSettings.ini`
