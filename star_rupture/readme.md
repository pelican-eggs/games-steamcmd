> There are times where it appears that the game is not loaded in the management window but it is
> In case the game tells you that the server got multiple IP (especially after doing some management), just shut down the server a couple of minutes so that Steam Master server remove it from the list

After installing the game, the server cannot be joined immediatly and you have to create your game session (like Satisfactory or Icarus).

To do so you : a client who owns the game must launch it then go to "Manager server".
The game will ask for a password to protect the server management that will create a password.json on the server

After that a new windows will appear where :
- You can add a password to prevent unwelcomed connections to the game session
- You can create a new game session
- You can load a game session
- You can load a game session
